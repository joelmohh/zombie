## Zombs with out the IO - Survive
### What is Zombs with out the IO - Survive?
Zombs without the IO – Survive is a parody and fan-made project inspired by the IO game zombs.io, but focused on a singleplayer survival experience. 

The goal of the game is to survive waves of zombies, build defenses, and cooperate (or compete) with other players in a simplified but fun environment.

### How to Play
1. **Movement**: Use the W, A, S, D keys or the arrow keys to move your character around the map.
2. **Gather Resources**: Collect wood, stone, and other materials to build structures and defenses. (You need to use the axe)
3. **Build Defenses**: Use the resources you gather to build walls, turrets, and other defenses to protect yourself from zombie attacks.
4. **Survive Waves**: Zombies will attack in waves. Survive as long as you can by managing your resources and defenses.
5. **Upgrade**: As you survive longer, you can upgrade your weapons and defenses to better handle the increasing zombie threat.

### Controls
- **W / Up Arrow**: Move Up
- **A / Left Arrow**: Move Left
- **S / Down Arrow**: Move Down
- **D / Right Arrow**: Move Right
- **Mouse Click**: Interact with objects (gather resources, build, etc.)
